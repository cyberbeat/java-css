This is a modified version of JAVA-CSS, which was originally found here: http://java.net/projects/javacss/

Java-CSS is about styling swing GUIs with CSS-like stylesheets. It works quite well, and can be combined with layoutmanagers like miglayout for example.

It was introduced here http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2008/07/17/introducing-java-css by Ethan Nicholas.

I removed javafx-support and fixed a memory leak.
